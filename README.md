# Code Refactor - Ticket

## Description 

Base code had bad css and html semantics; cleaned all of those up.  Then 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
